# photocopy
Automatically mount and copy photos from an Android device.

Place the 'photocopy' file into your local bin folder, such as:

/home/guru/bin

Then edit the path to where the rest of the files are located.  You will also
need to edit the 'photocopy.php' file to set some paths.

Simply plug in your Android device, and type 'photocopy'.
